# muRisQ-ir-models by Marc Henrard

muRisQ Advisory open source code for Interest Rate Models.

muRisQ stands for Management of Risk by Quantitative methods. The term risk management has to be understood in a large sense which includes risk strategies, ALM, quantitative impacts of regulation, and trading strategies.

# Repository content

This repository proposes code for pricing and risk management of interest rate derivatives.

The models implemented are based on proprietary research and academic literature as described in each implementation.

Comments and suggestions for improvements are welcome.

## Foundations

Some code proposed in this repository is based on OpenGamma Strata (version 2.12.0) library: http://strata.opengamma.io/

## Curves

### 1. Overnight-Overnight conventions and nodes
Swap conventions to deal with EFFR-SOFR and EONIA-ESTER transition. Associated template and nodes to calibrate curves.

### 2. FX Swap overnight nodes. 
To deal with the very short end of the FX curves. ON and TN specific market conventions in term of quotation.

### 3. Multiply curve
Curve description as the multiplication of two underlying curves. Used for intra-month seasonal adjustment in overnight-curves.

### 4. Collateral cheapest-to-deliver

## Models

### 1. Bachelier Formula

#### Description
Explicit formula for implicit volatility.

#### References

### 2. Hull-White one-factor
* Convexity adjustment for futures. Implementation with flexible start and end date.
* Pricing of compounded overnight futures. Reference: Henrard, Marc. (2018) Overnight based futures: convexity adjustment estimation. Available at (https://ssrn.com/abstract=3134346).
* Different formulas for cross-terms: same model parameters (Asian options) or different model parameters (discounting transition)
* Pricing of CMS coupons/caplets/floorlets by efficient approximation.
* Pricing of Swaption with Par Yield cash settlement using an efficient (third order) approximation.

### 3. G2++

#### Code 
* Parameters description
* Different formulas for variance and volatility in different setup
* Pricing of European swaptions (physical settlement) with efficient explicit approximation and with numerical integration 2D.

### 4. Swaption with 2 collateral

Pricing of swaps and swaptions when two collateral rates are used: one for the swaption itself up to a given date before expiry and one other from that date on, including for the delivered swap. Swaption pricing with shifted SABR for physical delivery and par yield cash settlement.

### 5. LIBOR/Forward Market Model

#### Description
LIBOR or Forward Market Model (also called BGM - Brace/Gatarek/Musiela) with displaced diffusion and deterministic LIBOR/OIS spread. The model dynamic is on the forward associated to pseudo-discount factors in a multi-curve and collateral discounting approach. Multi-factor model.

#### Code 
* Parameters description
* European physical delivery swaptions price by efficient approximation (preditor-corrector type)
* Monte Carlo rate evolution (Predictor-corrector style)
* Monte Carlo pricers:
  * European swaption
  * IBOR Ratchet
  * CMS coupon, caplet, floorlet
  * Generalized CMS spread coupon, caplet, floorlet

### 5. Rational Multi-curve Model

#### Description
The model describes the evolution of the discount curve and the Libor process in an explicit way. The quantities are not presented through a SDE but directly as explicit quantities depending on simple random variables. This leads to explicit dynamic and in general (almost) explicit formulas for simple instruments and very easy Monte Carlo simulations.

# Professional services

The models proposed here are only a small part of the code we have developed or have access to for research and advisory services purposes. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you are interested by other models, require advisory services or are looking for a training around similar models.

## Trainings and workshops

We propose in-house training and workshops on subjects related to quantitative finance and risk management.

We offer extensive flexibility on the training organization.

A in-house tailor-made course with our experts presented to your full team often costs less than sending two people to a standard course organized by a large training firm.

*Agenda tailored to your needs. Detailed lecture notes.*
*Associated to open source code for practical implementation.*
*Training in English or in French*

Some of the popular courses are (course description and typical agendas available through the links):
